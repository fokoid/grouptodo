# grouptodo
Group todo list app created as part of the Google Developer Scholarship 2017

## Contributing

* The `master` branch is protected, meaning *no pushes allowed*.
* To contribute, checkout a new branch of the form `your_initials/branch_name`,
  e.g. if I wanted to check out a branch for a code refactor I would call it
  `at/refactor`.
* When code is ready to be merged, make a pull request to master. Any
  contributor except the PR owner can approve the PR and merge it.
